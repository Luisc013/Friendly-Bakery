    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Since opening on January 25, 2007, Gâteau Sacré has offered a variety of baked goods to satisfy anyone with the hunger for a tasty, sweet treat. The pastry shop offers a variety of doughnuts, Danish, muffins, croissants, and Philadelphia favorites such as sticky buns and mouthwatering butter cake. One sniff of the nose, while strolling down Kings Highway in the early morning hours, will draw you in to the shop to sample some of their delicious creations. Cakes are a specialty too at Gâteau Sacré. The shop feels as though every birthday is special, and any special occasion should be celebrated with cake including weddings, baby and bridal showers, anniversaries, etc. or just a special day. Cakes are always available but special orders require 24 to 36 hours. For your next occasion, the shop can customize your special creation with various cake selections, different flavored fillings and icing. Just call the shop and anyone will be happy to assist you with your special order. Creativity is always appreciated. Gâteau Sacré is the creation of Jack Frombach, formerly of John William’s European Pastry Shoppe in Meddleford, MI, with over 30 years of baking experience, and Karen Morrison who has been around bakeries her entire life. The pair grew up together in Northeast Philadelphia where Jack’s parents owned a bakery. “We wanted to create an old fashioned bakery where people can obtain fresh quality, made from scratch sweets”, says Karen. So far, they have created that in Swedesboro. Customers have been very satisfied with their product and return over and over again. Long time residents of the area are excited to see a bakery in Swedesboro again and those who have moved from other areas do not have to travel far to obtain fresh delicious pastries.</p>
